## Welcome to the best Adjustable Tic-Tac-Toe game engine implementation in Kotlin!

Firstly: what is "Tic-Tac-Toe"?  
An ancient, very simple, and popular game that almost everybody played on paper during childhood.  
Tic-Tac-Toe = Noughts and Crosses = Xs and Os = many names, but the essence is the same.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Well, you know the game, it's fairly easy, BUT...
- what if we want something **more than a standard 3x3 game field**?
- what if we like a 10x10 field or even 1000x1000 with **customizable winning line length**?
- what if we need **more than 2 players** on this enlarged game field?
- and - what if we'd love to play it in **3D (e.g. 10x10x10)**? - isn't it interesting?

### This repository provides you with a free-to-use tested game engine that satisfies all the requirements above.
You can use it for any (suitable to a Kotlin library) frontend/UI implementation of your Tic-Tac-Toe game.

This repository also contains different samples of console & UI clients for this game engine - mostly for UX testing purposes.  
**The project board** is here - https://github.com/users/igor-shaula/projects/3.  
**Discussions are open** here - https://github.com/igor-shaula/Adjustable_TicTacToe/discussions.
